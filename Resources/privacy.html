<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This is the privacy policy of Nonstrict B.V. ("Nonstrict"). It was last changed on January 29, 2024.

<h2>Who is responsible for the processing of your personal data?</h2>
<p>Nonstrict B.V. (Australi&euml;ring 33, Amersfoort, trade register number 89067657) is the controller of personal data within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") for the processing activities listed below in this privacy statement.

<h2>What's Nonstrict's approach regarding privacy?</h2>
<p>Nonstrict is very committed to respecting your privacy.

<p>Nonstrict's business model is based on creating great services and products, not on widespread collection and marketing of user data. This means we'll only collect data we need to deliver our products and services to you, and to learn how to make it work better for you.

<p>As such we aim to process as little personal data as possible, and to be as transparent as possible about the data that we do collect.

<p>Our control only goes so far as the product and/or service we provide: please be aware that as a user, you are responsible for data you record or mirror.
